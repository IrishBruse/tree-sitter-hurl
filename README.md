# tree-sitter-hurl

Tree-sitter parser for the [hurl](https://hurl.dev/) file format.

This repo tries to follow the hurl grammar as closely as possible with some
exceptions. Some modifications are made to support tree-sitter and to allow for
better highlighting.

## Acknowledgements

* The grammar is based off of [hurl's grammar file](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/hurl/blob/master/docs/spec/hurl.grammar).
